## User diversity in social networks and the impact of link recommendation algorithms on it

### Abstract

By social network we usually refer to a set of entities and how they interact with each other.
Typically, the social network is represented as a graph in which the entities (individual people,
or things) are the nodes and interactions (or relationships) between them are the edges, or
links. With regard to social networks, we study the problem of low diversity between linked
nodes. Low diversity exists when the nodes tend to be linked to similar others. More over we
study the effect of link prediction and link recommendation algorithms on diversity; if they
also suggest to nodes, similar ones for connection. By defining similarity, analyzing some
social networks and performing some experiments, we prove that the diversity is actually low
and algorithms affect it. We also explain why this is a bad phenomenon.
Specifically, this diploma thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter contains an
introduction to the problem we are studying. The second chapter refers to link prediction and
recommendation algorithms used for the experiments. The third chapter concerns the
creation of a synthetic network, experiments on it and conclusions that come out. Accordingly,
the fourth chapter concerns the creation of a network of actual data, experiments on it and the
conclusions that come out. Finally, the fifth chapter summarizes the whole process and the
conclusions that have emerged and contains some ideas for future work.
